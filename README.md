## Introduction

For this challenge, my job consisted of created the logical elements for the correct usage of a daily planner. To accomplish the tasks given, I had to use my current habilities with DOM manipulation, for loops and third party APIs like DayJS and the correct use of these elements with JavaScript.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am - 5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Visual Web Application
Finally, I present the final visual result of the web application's appearance and functionality:

![A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.](./Assets/Images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202024-01-25%20a%20la(s)%201.24.35â€¯p.m..png)
